# How to run the project
Go to `File > Build And Run`. Since no dependencies have been installed and it only uses Uinty elements, normal `Buuild And Run` will suffice.

# Thought process for solving the task
1. The first thing that I did was to analyse the JSON that was being fetch and then created structured class to sotre these data.
1. Then, I figured out which data were to be displayed to the user and which ones will be used only within the code.
1. For the UI design, I looked at some templates for reference and then designed my own UI using `Figma`. Here is the link for the design https://www.figma.com/design/39DNNm2rIv23qmr6tcx5rW/RealfyOasisAssignment?node-id=1-2997&t=M1lVWed3TsLBOSKc-1. The filter feature was left out due to time constrains.

# Any assumptions or creative decisions made
There wasn't much information available about the use case of the assignment so I tried not to make much assumptions. The creative choice I made was to add the `Grid View` and `List View`. Other than that there wasn't any big changes that I made.
